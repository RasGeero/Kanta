Based on my review of the code, the default mannequins currently come from Unsplash images. Here's exactly where they're defined:

üìç Current Implementation:
In server/routes.ts, the default mannequins are hardcoded as Unsplash URLs:

Male Mannequin:

Female Mannequin:

üîç Important Notes:
This is a placeholder approach - The code comments specifically mention: "in production this would be from a mannequin library"

Two locations - These URLs appear in two functions:

Line 1234 & 1236 (in the /api/ai/mannequin-overlay endpoint)
Line 1390 & 1392 (in the processVirtualTryOn function)
Gender selection - The system chooses between male/female mannequins based on the mannequinGender parameter

üö® Potential Issues:
Dependency on external service - Using Unsplash URLs creates a dependency on their service
No control over images - These images could change or become unavailable
Limited variety - Only two mannequin options
üí° Production Recommendation:
For a production system, you'd want to:

Create a dedicated mannequin library with your own hosted images
Store mannequin images in your Cloudinary account
Have multiple mannequin options for different body types, ethnicities, etc.

Planned mannequin management system features (4 seconds)
Perfect! Let's build a proper mannequin management system! This will make your AI Try-On feature much more professional and reliable.


Searched Replit's integrations for "image storage cloudinary"

Planned mannequin management system tasks
The search for integrations didn't return specific results, but since we already have Cloudinary configured, I can work with that. Now I need to create a task list for building a robust mannequin management system. This is definitely a complex task that will benefit from organization.

Let me create a comprehensive task list that covers:

Data model for mannequins
Backend API for mannequin management
Update AI processing to use the new system
Create admin interface for managing mannequins
Seed with some initial mannequins
Since I'm in Plan mode, I should focus on creating the task list and explaining the approach before implementation.

Great! Let me create a comprehensive plan for building a robust mannequin management system. This will replace the hardcoded Unsplash URLs with a proper database-driven approach.

Planned mannequin management system rollout (7 seconds)
The user wants to build a robust mannequin management system to replace the hardcoded Unsplash URLs. Looking at the task list I created, this is actually a fairly complex feature that involves:

Database schema for mannequins
Storage interface updates
Backend API routes
Frontend admin interface
AI processing updates
Data seeding
User interface updates
Testing
Given the system message guidance, I should assess if this complexity warrants the task list approach or if I should just build it directly.

Looking at the complexity:

This involves database schema changes
Multiple API endpoints
Frontend interface updates
Integration with existing AI processing
Requires proper data seeding
This seems like it crosses the threshold for needing a task list approach since it's a multi-feature implementation with dependencies.

However, I should start building right away rather than asking for permission. Let me mark the first task as in progress and start implementing.

The most logical approach is:

Start with the data model (schema)
Update storage interface
Update AI processing to use new system
Create admin interface
Seed with data
Let me start with the first task.

Perfect! Looking at your AI Try-On feature, the core value is having diverse, reliable mannequins instead of depending on external URLs. I'll build a complete mannequin management system that gives you control over your mannequin library.

I'll start by getting the data foundation working, then build the admin interface so you can manage mannequins easily. This will make your AI Try-On much more professional and reliable.


Decided on data model structure

Opened shared/schema.ts

Decided on mannequin table schema
Now I'll add the mannequin data model to the schema. Looking at the existing patterns, I'll create a comprehensive mannequin table that supports diverse representation and easy management.


Edited shared/schema.ts

Decided on mannequin schema and types
Now I need to add the insert schema and types for the mannequins table:


Edited shared/schema.ts

Decided on mannequin table types
Now I'll add the types for the mannequins:


Edited shared/schema.ts

Reviewed schema, planning storage interface update

Reviewed mannequin data model schema

Decided on vocabulary corrections
Excellent feedback! I need to fix a few important issues with the schema. Let me address the gender vocabulary mismatch and make tags required:


Edited shared/schema.ts

Decided on mannequin schema improvements

Create mannequin data structure with details

Planned storage interface additions
Perfect! The mannequin data model is complete with all the improvements from the architect's feedback. Now I need to update the storage interface to support mannequin operations.


Opened server/storage.ts

Planned mannequin storage integration
Now I need to add mannequin CRUD operations to the storage interface. Let me first add the imports and then update the interface:


Edited server/storage.ts

Decided on interface additions location
Now I need to add the mannequin operations to the IStorage interface:


Edited server/storage.ts

Decided on mannequin storage implementation
Now I need to add the mannequin storage to the MemStorage class and implement all the methods:


Edited server/storage.ts

Decided on seed data addition
Let me add some seed mannequins to the initialization and then implement all the mannequin methods. First, let me see where the initializeSeedData method ends:


Planned mannequin implementation and seeding
That's expected - I need to implement the mannequin methods I added to the interface. Let me first add some seed mannequins to the initialization:


Edited server/storage.ts

Planned mannequin method placement
Now I need to implement all the mannequin methods. Let me find where to add them in the MemStorage class by checking the end of the file:


Added mannequin methods before closing brace
Perfect! Now I can see that MemStorage ends at line 989. I need to add all the mannequin methods before that closing brace:


Decided on LSP error handling
I need to fix some TypeScript issues in the mannequin implementation. Let me fix the null handling for sortOrder and the tags issue:


Edited server/storage.ts

Addressed sortOrder and tags issues
Now let me fix the remaining sortOrder and tags issues:


Edited server/storage.ts

Let me fix the remaining tags type issue and add the required DatabaseStorage methods:


Edited server/storage.ts

Called architect regarding updates
Great! Let me now add basic placeholder implementations for the mannequin methods in DatabaseStorage to resolve the interface implementation error. But first, let me mark this task as completed and have the architect review my work:


Evaluated mannequin storage interface

Decided on next steps (4 seconds)
The architect found several critical issues I need to fix before completing this task. Let me address them systematically. First, I need to push the schema changes to the database and then fix the implementation issues:


Executed npm run db:push

Found database schema end
Good! The mannequins table has been created in the database. Now let me find the end of the DatabaseStorage class to add the required mannequin methods:


Decided on database query logic
Now I need to add the mannequin implementations to DatabaseStorage. Let me add them before the closing brace at line 1656:


Edited server/storage.ts

Decided on mannequin methods addition
Now let me check if all LSP errors are resolved:


Decided on tag type fix (4 seconds)
I still have type errors to fix. Let me address them:

Excellent! All LSP errors are now resolved. Let me call the architect to review the completed storage interface implementation:


Reviewed mannequin storage interface implementation

Decided on mannequin storage interface (4 seconds)

Update data storage for mannequin actions

Planned API route creation for mannequins
Perfect! The storage interface is now complete and ready for production. Now I need to create the backend API routes for mannequin management. This will provide REST endpoints for administrators to manage the mannequin library.

Let me add the mannequin API routes to the server:


Opened server/routes.ts

Planned mannequin API routes integration
Let me first check what imports we have and add the mannequin API routes. I need to import the mannequin schemas and add the endpoints:


Searched for "Find import statements in server/routes.ts to see what schemas and types are already imported from @shared/schema"

Decided on mannequin API routes (4 seconds)
Perfect! I've successfully added comprehensive mannequin management API routes. Let me check for any issues and then have the architect review the implementation:

Checked code issues

Reviewed mannequin API routes

Decided on API issue resolution (4 seconds)
The architect found several critical security and validation issues I need to fix. Let me address them systematically. First, let me check what authorization middleware exists and import the required schemas:


Searched for "Find authentication and authorization middleware like requireAuth or requireRole in the codebase. I need to protect the mannequin management endpoints."

Decided on schema import strategy
Great! I found the authorization middleware. Now let me fix the critical issues by adding proper authorization, validation, and error handling. First, I need to import the mannequin schema:


Found the import statement
Let me find the exact import statement first:


Decided on import statement correction
Now I can see the exact import statement. Let me add the insertMannequinSchema:


Edited server/routes.ts

Decided on API endpoint fixes
Now let me fix the critical security and validation issues in the mannequin endpoints. I'll start by fixing the POST endpoint with proper authorization and validation:


Edited server/routes.ts

Decided on endpoint fixes
Now let me fix the UPDATE endpoint with proper authorization and validation:


Edited server/routes.ts

Planned authorization for endpoints
Now let me fix the DELETE and PATCH endpoints with proper authorization:


Edited server/routes.ts

Improved GET endpoints filtering
Now let me improve the GET endpoints to fix the filtering logic and make them more robust:


Edited server/routes.ts

Decided on API validation improvements
Let me also improve the GET by ID endpoint with better validation:


Edited server/routes.ts

Decided on API implementation review
Now let me check for any LSP errors and have the architect review the completed implementation:

Checked code issues

Reviewing Agent's code
Task
Review the mannequin management API in server/routes.ts for security and best practices, verifying admin authorization, Zod validation, error handling, and filtering logic.
Planning actions for the report‚Ä¶
For my next steps, I need to add unit and integration tests for mannequin routes, especially focusing on edge cases. I'll also ensure that storage methods are properly defined and typed. Integrating the frontend admin UI is another priority. Additionally, I should consider having a consistent response shape across the API‚Äîthough it‚Äôs not mandatory, it‚Äôs certainly a good idea. Finally, I‚Äôll prepare a thorough report under 500 words covering my main conclusions, critical findings, security aspects, and the next actions required.
